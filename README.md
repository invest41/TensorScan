# Hi everyone, <br>
<img width="1269" alt="pic_model" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70070334/173198720-e3f3416f-12aa-49ea-a3b7-d58353b8774f.png">

Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, and when detected at an early stage, it can be treated before it spreads.  

To curb this menace, we've successfully built a brilliant deep learning backed system of algorithms, that would accurately detect the Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) type of breast cancer from images of tissue samples.  
Here, the deep learning algorithm studies critically, thousands of images from tissues and is able to learn patterns (weights) that exist in these samples via Supervised Learning through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), so that it can accurately predict the presence of Breast cancer in an image, and hence save lives.  
  

This is a screening tool that helps process tissue samples for cancer, giving results at an incredible speed!  
We are combining our unique AI technology with Edge Computing & Blockchain technology, to aid with a distributed and secure architecture, that promotes authenticity and intregation of the Lab datasets processed by our AI technology.
